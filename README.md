An idea to explore the profiles of followers on twitter.

Sometimes in my user research for software tools, I like to look at profiles of twitter followers - to understand their roles, and motivations for choosing a technology.

But really there are so many interesting reasons to explore the followers of a user:

- To see if there is a commonality of followers - to see if the person tweets to a group you match
- To learn more about the network of a Twitter id, to research that person

Here's [an example](http://goo.gl/IgzYUG "Blog about followers profiles of election candidates") of where I've used it during an election to understand the candidates from their social media profiles.

I thought it would be a fun project to write some code to look for patterns en masse.

I'd also like to use this project to experiment with some sorting algorithms.
