An idea to explore the profiles of followers on twitter.

Sometimes in my user research for software tools, I like to look at profiles of twitter followers - to understand their roles, and motivations for choosing a technology.

I thought it would be a fun project to write some code to look for patterns en masse.

I have some ideas.

I'd also like to use this project to experiment with some sorting algorithms.
